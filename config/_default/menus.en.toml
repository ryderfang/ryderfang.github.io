# -- Main Menu --
# The main menu is displayed in the header at the top of the page.
# Acceptable parameters are name, pageRef, page, url, title, weight.
# 
# The simplest menu configuration is to provide:
#   name = The name to be displayed for this menu link
#   pageRef = The identifier of the page or section to link to
#
# By default the menu is ordered alphabetically. This can be
# overridden by providing a weight value. The menu will then be
# ordered by weight from lowest to highest.

[[main]]
  name = "Articles"
  pageRef = "posts"
  weight = 9

[[main]]
  name = "Algorithms"
  pageRef = "leetcode"
  weight = 10

#[[main]]
#  name = "Categories"
#  pageRef = "categories"
#  weight = 30


# -- Footer Menu --
# The footer menu is displayed at the bottom of the page, just before
# the copyright notice. Configure as per the main menu above.
